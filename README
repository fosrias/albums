== Welcome to Albums

Albums is just an example web app. It's a little "online store" for buying
music.

It uses rspec + capybara + rack-test for testing and includes some model
specs and some request specs.

It uses haml, sass, and coffeescript.


== Getting Started

1. Check out the repository.

2. `bundle`. This only needs to be run when the gem dependencies change.

3. `bundle exec rspec spec` to run all the tests.

4. `bundle exec rails server` to run the server.
